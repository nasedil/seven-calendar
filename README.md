# My own calendar system

Work is in the earliest stage of development.

TODO list:
 * What to do with dates before birth date?
 * How to handle days after death?
 * factory methods?

## Short notes

Sometimes I use a system to write a date with origin as my date of birth.  So I write this software to automatically convert dates to/from my calendar.
