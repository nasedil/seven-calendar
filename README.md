# My own calendar system

Work is in the earliest stage of development.

## TODO list:
### Calendar itself
 * Add calendar description
### The library
 * Support both python 2 and python 3 and test both with test script
 * have better tests
 * Add link to calendar explanation
 * add alternative __str__ methods
 * add coding guidelines
 * add development notes

### Other stuff
 * make library in JavaScript (well, initially thought of making this is JavaScript, python version is just a coincidence, because I was too lazy for couple of years and forgot)
 * Add links to projects related to the calendar

## Short notes

Sometimes I use a system to write a date with origin as my date of birth.  So I write this software to automatically convert dates to/from my calendar.
