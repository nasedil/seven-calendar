# My own calendar system

Work is in the earliest stage of development.

## TODO list:
### Calndar itself
 * What to do with dates before birth date?
 * How to handle days after death?
 * Add calendar description
### The library
 * Add testing script
 * Support both python 2 and python 3 and test both with test script
 * have better tests
 * Add link to calendar explanation
 * Add method to convert from 7cal to regular date
 * add alternative __str__ methods
 * add coding guidelines
 * add development notes
 * add license
 * make installable package

### Other stuff
 * make library in javascript (well, initially thought of making this is javascript, python version is just a coincidence, because I was too lazy for couple of years and forgot)
 * Add links to projects related to the calendar

## Short notes

Sometimes I use a system to write a date with origin as my date of birth.  So I write this software to automatically convert dates to/from my calendar.
